# There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

# You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

# Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
# Output: 700
# Explanation:
# The graph is shown above.
# The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
# Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

# Approach
# using bellman-ford graph algo

            # run loop till k times
            tmpPrices = prices.copy() # create a copy of the prices array

            for s, d, p in flights:
                # run loop on the flights array, where each obj has source - s, destination - d and price - p

            prices = tmpPrices
        return -1 if prices[dst] == float("inf") else prices[dst] # return -1 if the destination price is still inf else destination price
