# There is a foreign language which uses the latin alphabet, but the order among letters is not "a", "b", "c" ... "z" as in English.

# You receive a list of non-empty strings words from the dictionary, where the words are sorted lexicographically based on the rules of this new language.

# Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order is invalid, return an empty string. If there are multiple valid order of letters, return any of them.

# A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if either of the following is true:

# The first letter where they differ is smaller in a than in b.
# a is a prefix of b and a.length < b.length.
