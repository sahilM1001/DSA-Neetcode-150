# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

# Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 42
# Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

# Approach

# For each node, consider it as the highest point of a potential path.
# A path can pass through a node as:

# left-subtree → node → right-subtree

# So for every node we need two things:

# Maximum downward path from its left child
# Maximum downward path from its right child
# A downward path ends at that child and goes only downward (no turning back up).
# This is computed using getMax().

# Then we compute the best full path through this node:

# node.val + leftDown + rightDown
# We try this for every node using DFS and update the global answer.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    def maxPathSum(self, root) -> int:
        res = -float('inf')
        def dfs(root):
            nonlocal res
            if not root:
                return
            left = self.getMax(root.left)
            right = self.getMax(root.right)
            res =max(res, root.val + left + right)
            dfs(root.left)
            dfs(root.right)
        dfs(root)
        return res
    def getMax(self, root) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        left = self.getMax(root.left)
        right = self.getMax(root.right)
        path = root.val + max(left, right)
        return max(0, path)
